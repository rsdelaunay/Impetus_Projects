Welcome to my repository!

This repository includes all the Java, C, HTML and Shell projects I've personally made in my adventure through my Bachelors in Computer Science lectured at ISCTE (Lisbon, Portugal)
as well as my own personal courses taken, namely CS50 Web Programming and CS50 Computer Science through edx platform.

Feel free to contact me through e-mail if you want to share some ideas and build awesome projects - rodlxl2011@gmail.com

Best regards,
Rodrigo Delaunay
