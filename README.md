Welcome to my personal repository!

This repository includes all the Java, C, HTML and Shell projects I've personally made in my own adventure outside my university teaching grounds. These include courses that I've personally taken, namely:
- CS50's Introduction to Computer Science;
- CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

Feel free to contact me through e-mail if you want to share some ideas and build awesome projects - rodlxl2011@gmail.com

Best regards,
Rodrigo Delaunay
